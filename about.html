          <h3>About</h3>
          <p>Hi, I'm Leandro Dornelas and I am a Systems Analyst from Brazil. I have moved to Vancouver, Canada on March 2016 to study at BCIT.</p>
          <p>I worked at Infraero, which is a governmental brazilian enterprise responsible to take care of public funded brazilian airports infrastructure. I worked primarily at analysis and design, but I was also engaged in our software quality assurance. I helped my team to create and improve the development process and introduced a more systematic testing process.</p>
          <p>I also helped my team to achieve CMMI level 2. In 2011, I have introduced agile methodologies and practices based on SCRUM and XP and I have also used Kanban in order to improve our process.</p>
          <p>Most recently, I have become passionate about web development and I am looking forward to develop my skills on that field.</p>
          <p>When I'm not writing use cases, developing and testing software and now web sites, I enjoy reading books, training martial arts, watching MMA, and having a good time with my family and friends.</p>
